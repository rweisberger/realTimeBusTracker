## realTimeBusTracker

### Description
<p> This application uses the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) api to get real-time bus information. Click on the route you want and bus icons will appear in their current locations, red for inbound and blue for outbound. Click and you will see popups that indicate outbound and inboud direction and seat availability.</p>

### How to Run
<p> Go to Mapbox.com and <b> get an API access token </b> and add it to the realTimeBusTracker.js file. Download the files and open the index.html file in your browser. </p>

### Roadmap
<p> Add additional routes, inprove sylying, make mobile compatible, improve recentering with "flyto" feature and add a map key for bus colors instead of including the information in the popup. </p>
