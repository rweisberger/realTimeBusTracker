## realTimeBusTracker

### Description
<p> This will show markers for all the buses running on route 1 in Boston. The location of each bus will update every 15 seconds. </p>

### How to Run
<p> Go to Mapbox.com and <b> get an API access token </b> and add it to the realTimeBusTracker.js file. Download the files and open the index.html file in your browser. </p>

### Roadmap
<p> I would like to change the markers to a small bus and possibly change the color so that outbound and inbound buses are different colors. </p>
